# Scraping_TvShows24
In this project, we can see the scraping codes in Rstudio. The goal is to create our data from the following link:  https://www.imdb.com/list/ls522886649/?view=detailed&amp;sort=user_rating,desc&amp;st_dt=&amp;mode=detail&amp;page=1&amp;ref_=ttls_vm_dtl In it, we get the best TV shows of 2024 which are broken down by name, year, genre, rating, vote, and synopses.
